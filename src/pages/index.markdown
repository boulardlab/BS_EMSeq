This is an immunology-epigenetics project between the [Boulard lab](https://www.embl.org/groups/boulard/) at EMBL Rome and the Storck lab at Institut Necker Enfants-Malades in Paris.

Reference: [paper in preparation]

This website shows the results of the analysis of EMSeq data in Naive (time 0) and Germinal Center (day 7 and day 14 of GC reaction) B cells with conditional pro-B cells knock-out of the *HELLS* gene mouse homologue *Lsh*.

**Repository of the project with source code** is [here](https://github.com/boulardlab/BS_EMSeq).

# Content

The genome-wide DNA methylation main analysis is in [Analysis](https://boulardlab.github.io/BS_EMSeq/2020/10/20/analysis.html)

Methylation of Transposable Elements (TE) is specifically analysed in [TE Analysis](https://boulardlab.github.io/BS_EMSeq/2020/11/17/TE-analysis.html)

The correlation between methylation loss and expression of single copy genes is in [Meth Expr Corr](https://boulardlab.github.io/BS_EMSeq/2022/12/07/meth-expr-corr.html)
